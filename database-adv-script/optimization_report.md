# 📝 Optimization Report – Airbnb Clone Query Performance

## 🎯 Objective
Refactor complex queries to improve performance by analyzing execution plans and applying optimization techniques.

---

## 🔍 Initial Query Overview

**Purpose:**  
Retrieve all bookings with their associated **user details**, **property details**, and **payment details**.

### **Issues Identified:**
- Multiple JOINs increased execution time.
- Missing indexes led to full table scans.
- Queries were not scalable for large datasets.

---

## ⚡ Performance Analysis

Using query analysis tools (EXPLAIN/ANALYZE), it was observed that:
- JOIN operations on unindexed columns significantly degraded performance.
- The query was fetching unnecessary columns due to `SELECT *` usage.

---

## 🔧 Refactoring & Optimization Strategies

### ✅ Changes Applied:
1. **Added Indexes** on high-usage columns:
   - `user_id` in users and bookings
   - `property_id` in properties and bookings
   - `booking_id` in bookings and payments

2. **Replaced INNER JOIN with LEFT JOIN** where applicable to avoid excluding bookings lacking payment records.

3. **Selected only required columns** to reduce data load and improve efficiency.

---

## 🚀 Results After Optimization

- **Reduced query execution time** due to effective index usage.
- **Improved scalability** for handling larger datasets in production.
- **Optimized JOIN operations**, enhancing responsiveness for user-facing features.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Indexing high-usage columns and refactoring complex queries are essential steps in ensuring **efficient, scalable, and production-ready backend systems**, particularly for an Airbnb clone where relational data interactions are frequent and critical.
